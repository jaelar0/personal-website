The dataset was sourced from the data science website Kaggle, and although the exact source is unknown, the admins 
rated it as 'gold' for its usability. 
The first step of pre-processing was to profile the borrowers into a 'good' group and a 'bad' group. 
This step entailed typical data scrubbing activities such as assigning loans to borrowers, calculating the loan start 
and end dates, calculating loan term and months on the book, as well as other calculations necessary for our analysis. 
Much easier said than done, but the actions taken lead us into our 
definition of a 'bad' borrower. If following along in the code, we can see that when a loan status 
is equal to either '2', '3', '4', or '5', we are setting that borrower as 'bad'. In other words, if a loan payment 
is more than 60 days overdue, we are classifying that borrower as 'bad'. The end result is a cleaned dataframe, 
named all_data in the code, that houses 
all the necessary fields to create our features and target variables.
